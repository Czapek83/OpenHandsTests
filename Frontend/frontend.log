Warning: Running a server with --disable-host-check is a security risk. See https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a for more information.
The "disableHostCheck" option will not be used because it is not supported by the "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application" builder.
Component HMR has been enabled.
If you encounter application reload issues, you can manually reload the page to bypass HMR and/or disable this feature with the `--no-hmr` command line option.
Please consider reporting any issues you encounter here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues
